PHYS 4250 Assignment 3

Main functions are located in CamelCase file names. RunMeFirst.m completes the first part of task two, and RunMeSecond.m completes the second part of task two.

Parameters are set in the Parameters.m file.

GetData.m is used for domains with a large number of points (it implements sparse matrices). GetDataFull.m is for everything else and uses canonical matrices.

Matrices are built in BuildMatrices.m

Results are plotted live (or not, if you want) with the PlotResults.m function.

The Optimize.m file was used for figure out what parameters were actually well behaved.

I also built some logistic functions that I'm happy with. Those can be demoed using the BilogisDemo.m file.
